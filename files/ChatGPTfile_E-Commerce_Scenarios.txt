Here are some example test cases for the login functionality of an e-commerce website:

1. Verify that the login page is displayed correctly with the appropriate fields (username and password).
2. Verify that the user is able to enter a valid username and password combination.
3. Verify that the user is unable to login with an invalid username and password combination.
4. Verify that the user is unable to login with a valid username and incorrect password.
5. Verify that the user is unable to login with a valid password and incorrect username.
6. Verify that the user receives an appropriate error message when attempting to login with an invalid credentials.
7. Verify that the user is able to reset their password successfully.
8. Verify that the user is able to recover their username successfully.
9. Verify that the user is able to login using their social media accounts (e.g. Facebook, Google).
10. Verify that the user is redirected to the correct page after successful login.
11. Verify that the user is able to logout successfully and is redirected to the correct page.
12. Verify that the website has security measures in place (e.g. CAPTCHA) to prevent brute-force attacks on the login page.
13. Verify that the website has a time-out feature to automatically log out inactive users.
14. Verify that the user is prompted to verify their email address after successful registration.
15. Verify that user credentials are stored securely and not visible to other users or administrators.
16. Verify that the "Remember Me" feature works correctly, allowing the user to stay logged in across different sessions.
17. Verify that the website successfully handles concurrent logins from multiple devices or browsers.
18. Verify that the user is able to create a new account successfully and login using the newly created credentials.
19. Verify that the user can login using their email address instead of their username (if applicable).
20. Verify that the login process is quick and responsive, with appropriate loading indicators and error handling.

These are just a few examples, and depending on the specific requirements and functionality of the e-commerce website, additional test cases may be needed.
